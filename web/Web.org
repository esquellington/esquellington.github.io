#+STARTUP: indent overview

* REFERENCES
- Needs significant config https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-publish-html-tutorial.html
- Video from systemcrafters https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfkrzFodoNw
  - NOTES: https://systemcrafters.net/publishing-websites-with-org-mode/building-the-site/
  - Next on how to publish automatically to github https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=za99DwdZEyg
- Quick intro https://opensource.com/article/20/3/blog-emacs
- Good example https://clarete.li/blog/starting-a-blog.html site is on
  github so can be used as a ref
* TODO org-mode website
- Website as collection of .org files + data
- Landing page + menu + links + list of posts with date
- List of org-to-website options https://orgmode.org/worg/org-blog-wiki.html
** DONE weblorg: Nice simple blog using https://emacs.love/weblorg/ --> not great, try org-publish instead
- tried it but didn't seem to do much and it's not widely used, docs
  are a bit obscure and I couldn't care less about the details
** DONE ox-hugo: Seems a good alternative, less self-contained --> try to stay within Emacs/Org for evarything
- Requires Hugo that is powerful and complex and unnecessary, so
  ideally avoid
- https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/
** TODO ox-publish: Native and good enough it seems, judging from examples :WIP:
*** DONE publish.el
*** DONE Makefile or build.sh script
Several options, could just eval-buffer publish.el directly, but ideally we
want to use a clean/vanilla emacs with no init.el and strictly the
packages desired to org->website.
- Systemcrafters uses build.sh: emacs -Q
- others use: emacs --batch --load publish.el --funcall org-publish-all
*** DONE Serve site locally
- Systemcrafters shows way to do it within Emacs IIRC, no python needed
- simple-httpd
- Run (use-package simple-httpd :ensure t)
- M-x httpd-serve-directory
- shell:firefox http://localhost:8080/
*** DONE CSS/template/fonts/etc
- systemcrafters uses https://simplecss.org/ that looks good enough,
  can be served locally too, ensure no javascript and use it if so,
  don't waste time on cosmetics!
org-html-head "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdn.simplecss.org/simple.min.css\" />")
**** DONE make the CSS LOCAL
- This explains how https://opensource.com/article/20/3/blog-emacs
*** DONE Export LaTeX formulas to html
- works out of the box with Mathjax (remote javascript), requires
  whitelisting JS though
*** DONE Header + Footer
- See https://clarete.li/blog/starting-a-blog.html, I think
  html-preamble/postamble is what injects footer?
- Yeah, he has header/footer specific html with icons etc
  (fontawesome), very minimal but requires messing with generated HTML
  it seems... maybe there's a simpler/official way already?
- html-divs attrib also seems used sometimes to org pre/main/post as
  this, similar to org-html-head
  org-html-divs
      '((preamble  "header" "top")
        (content   "main"   "content")
        (postamble "footer" "postamble"))
**** DONE image --> link back to index
**** DONE Mastodon logo+link?
**** DONE Github logo+link?
**** DONE Footer
- Back to Top (anchor?)
- Back to Index
- Credits
  - With Emacs+Org (links and logos?)
  - With Simple.css (https://simplecss.org/)
  - etc...
**** DONE Icons
- https://fontawesome.com
- People seem to use fontawesome for icons, contains many of them,
  github, email, RSS, etc...
- Can be embedded as pure SVG, see header, good enough!
* TODO Fancy title?
* TODO RSS logo+link?
- See (require 'ox-rss)
* TODO Auto-publish to github
