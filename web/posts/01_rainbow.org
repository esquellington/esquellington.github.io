#+title: That time I saw a weird rainbow

In May 2019 I saw this mysterious rainbow over Edinburgh. At first
sight it looks like just another double rainbow, but if you focus on
the bases you can see that they intersect.

Double rainbows are concentric, so they're not supposed to intersect!
something else must be going on... so I started reading a bit to find
out exactly what.

It was a fun trip and I ended up with satisfying answer ([[So, what did I see?][spoiler]]) and
a new question ([[Test 2: Distances (to gold at the base!)][how far is the rainbow?]])

* Rain-bows-tiary

After this terrible pun, let's have a quick look at the different
kinds of rainbows that have been observed and studied.

** Single rainbow
A single *primary* bow can be seen when sunlight rays are refracted
once inside rain droplets, split into different wavelengths (colours)
and travel towards the observer at around /42 degrees/ backwards. More
details [[https://www.atoptics.co.uk/rainbows/primary.htm][here]].

** Concentric rainbows
Single rainbows are awesome on their own, but sometimes they're
accompained by additional concentric bows:
- A *secondary* bow is caused by extra refractions of light inside rain
  doplets. The secondary bow is concentric to primary one, appears
  outside and is and fainter. The secondary bow colors are
  reversed. Primary + secondary form the relatively frequent /double
  rainbow/ that everybody loves. More details [[https://www.atoptics.co.uk/rainbows/sec.htm][here]].

- Supernumerary bows are caused by lightwave interference.
  [[file:~/Escriptori/Rainbow/Rainbow-2017-08-18-A.jpg][Supernumeraries 1]], [[file:~/Escriptori/Rainbow/Rainbow-2017-08-18-B.jpg][Supernumeraries 2]] More detals [[https://www.atoptics.co.uk/rainbows/supers.htm][here]].

These are all very cool, but they're definitely not what I saw.

** Reflection rainbows
Reflection rainbows are formed by two separate bows, a primary one
caused by direct sunlight, and a reflection one above the primary,
caused by sunlight reflected on a reflective (water) surface, that
must be behind the observer and calm enough for sunlight to reflect in
a coherent direction, instead of scattering. More details [[https://www.atoptics.co.uk/rainbows/bowim6.htm][here]].

** Twinned rainbows
Twinned rainbows are *much* rarer, and apparently not yet fully
understood. A possible explanation is that they're primary bows that
bifurcate in some sections due to the presence of larger droplets that
become non-spherical under the effect of air friction, and refract
light in a slightly different direction, so the rays that reach the
observer come from slightly above/below the primary bow. More details
[[https://www.atoptics.co.uk/rainbows/bowim28.htm][here]].

* So, what did I see?
Given that the 2 rainbows in my picture were not concentric they could
only be a twinned primary bow, or a pair of primary and a reflection
bows. I very much suspected it was primary + reflection, but I had no
proof. A sane person would have probably stopped there. I didn't.

My shamelessly biased starting assumption was: /If I could prove that
a reflection bow was very likely, then it probably was, given how
rare twinned bows are, and how hard it would be to prove that it was a
twinned bow instead/.

So yeah, I essentially looked for my keys under the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streetlight_effect][streetlight]], not
where I probably lost them.

The good news is that using my picture, some basic trigonometry and
publically available maps and astronomical data, I arrived at a pretty
convincing answer: The picture matches a predicted reflection bow with
surprising accuracy, so it most likely was. Below I'll detail the
steps I followed.

** Sun angle and water position
This site shows the sun direction and altitude angle above the
horizon, relative to the camera position, at that time the picture was
taken
https://www.suncalc.org/#/55.9316,-3.1718,11/2019.05.21/21:00/1/3

A) Is there a water surface where the sun may reflect at that time?
Yes, the Firth of Forth overlaps the sun direction between
approximately 10km to 16km from the camera position

B) Does the vertical separation between regular and reflected bow in
the picture match the sun elevation angle? Yes, they match with around
3% error, which is quite low given that all magnitudes are approximate!

Now, a fun sideffect of knowing the approximate distance from the
camera to the water reflection is that it allows computing the
distance to the rainbow itself, which is NOT possible with a regular
bow.

* DONE Calcs

- IS it a twinned or a reflection rainbow?
- According to this https://www.atoptics.co.uk/rainbows/reflect.htm,
  sun reflection on water needs to happen BEHIND you to see BOTH,
  otherwise you may only see the reflected one. This diagram shows how
  it works quite intuitively http://www.eo.ucar.edu/rainbows/rnbw8.gif.
- By ear, the rainbow center was around 45 deg to my right wrt base
  point (behind chimmeney), casting a line from rainbow center
  direction backwards hits the Firth of Forth water mass at 10..15km.
- Sun config at time of pic 21/05/2019 21:00 can be computed here
  https://www.suncalc.org/#/55.9316,-3.1718,11/2019.05.21/21:00/1/3
  and matches direction I approximated, but yields water between 10km
  or 14km and 16.5km at my back, and a sun altitude of 2.7deg
- Ground height wrt sea level is 220ft (67m), from sea level, plus 3m
  at home, so 70m approx, but compared to dist to sea it's negligible
  http://en-gb.topographic-map.com/places/Edinburgh-89983/
- So the question is, given sun configuration, could it have been a
  reflection rainbow? if not, then it must be a twinned one
- This site https://www.atoptics.co.uk/fz439.htm also wonders "how far
  is the rainbow", and explains there is no answer (for simple bows)
** DONE Test 1: Angles (non-conclusive)
   - Does the image height (difference? ratio?) of the two bows in the
     picture match the predictied range for reflected bows at the
     existing range of distances to the sea?
   - Just checking bow height difference AND the known view angles for
     both wrt horizon we can decide if the bows may come from a reflection
   - BUT we're NOT accounting for distance-to-see at all, just picture
     heights/ratios, so it's not conclusive, it does not discard a
     reflection bow

Knowns:

Angles wrt horizon
  theta_p = 39.3deg
  theta_r = 44.7deg

Height wrt horizon, in picture
  y_p = 242 pixels
  y_r = 284 pixels

Unknowns:

Distance along horizon
  x_p == x_r

Assuming rectangle triangle wrt horizon, and assuming x_p == x_r
  tan(theta_p) = y_p / x
  tan(theta_r) = y_r / x

Thus, y_p / y_r should be tan(theta_p)/tan(theta_r), regardless of
unknown x.

  theta_r = tan(44.7) = 0.989582
  theta_p = tan(39.3) = 0.818491
  /= 1.209032231

  y_r = 284 pixels
  y_p = 242 pixels
  /= 1.173553719

Rel error:
  (1.209032231-1.173553719) / 1.209032231 = 3%


** DONE Test 2: Distances (to gold at the base!)
   - HOW can we validate distance-to-sea is compatible with reflection?
   - One idea is using d2s to compute actual height of the bows, and
     see if that's physically possible (1m would be stupid, 100km too)
   - Distance to bow base could also be computed from d2s, and also
     tested for consistency
   - How far was the gold at the base from me? combine X and Y to find
     it!

Knowns (reflection bow)
  Angles A=2.7, C=42, B = 135.3deg
  Distance-to-sea c = 10..16.5km, opposite to angle C

Distances from observer to rainbow h_r, opposite to angle A

Law of sines:
  a/sin(A) = b/sin(B) = c/sin(C)

So to find h_r == a from knowns
  a = c * sin(A)/sin(C)
    = c * sin(2.7)/sin(42)
    = c * 0.0703995

So for
  c = [10..16.5]km,

The distance to the top of the reflection bow is
  h_r = a = [0.7..1.16]km

And using h_r as hypotenusa, the horizontal distance to the bow base
would be
  cos(theta_r) = x_r / h_r
  x_r = h_r * cos(theta_r)
      = h_r * 0.710799
      = [0.497559..0.824527]km

And from this, we can compute height in km
  y_r = x_r * tan(theta_r)
      = x_r * 0.989582
      = [0.497559..0.824527] * 0.989582
      = [0.492375..0.815937]km

Finally, the distance to the pot of gold, which is the SAME to all
points in the bow, is therefore h_r = [0.7..1.16]km

** Accounting for camera height over sea level
According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon, horizon distance
is d = 3.57*sqrt(h) (d in km, h in meters), so at h=70m above esea
level d = 30km, QUITE far away, so FoF sure falls inside it, and
actually, we should worry about horizon distance at rainbow height,
which may be quite far up (h=1000m approx in picture, if reflection at
farthest FoF border), so d = 113km, not far enough for the west coast

  would have never reached the bottom of this rabbit hole without it.
