In May 2019 I saw this mysterious rainbow over Edinburgh. At first
sight it may look like a common double rainbow, but if you focus on
the bases you can see that they intersect.

Double rainbows are concentric, so they're not supposed to
intersect...  there was definitely something else going on, so I
started reading to find out exactly what. It was a fun trip and I
ended up with satisfying answer ([[So, what did I see?][spoiler]]) and a new [[QUESTION][question]].

/(NB: All pictures mine unless source explicitly stated)/

* Rain-bows-tiary

After this terrible pun, let's have a quick look at the different
kinds of rainbows that have been observed and studied, and try to
classify the one in the picture above.

** Single rainbow
A single *primary* bow can be seen when sunlight rays are refracted
once inside raindrops, split into different wavelengths (colours) and
travel towards the observer standing between the Sun and the
rainbow. Rays exit the droplet at an angle of /42 degrees/ downwards
relative to the original sunlight direction, as depicted below
(Source: [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Rainbow1.svg][Wikipedia Commons]])

** Concentric rainbows
Single rainbows are awesome on their own, but sometimes they're
accompained by additional concentric bows:
- A *secondary* bow can appear around the primary one, caused by a
  second refraction of sunlight inside rain droplets. The secondary bow
  is concentric to primary one, appears approximately /10 degrees/
  outside, is significantly fainter and its colors are
  reversed. Primary + secondary form the relatively common "double
  rainbow" that everybody loves. More details [[https://www.atoptics.co.uk/rainbows/sec.htm][here]].
- Supernumerary bows can appear adjacent to the inside of any bow and
  seem to repeat the same color pattern, but compressed. They are
  caused by lightwave interference, which is awesome, but we won't dig
  any deeper for now. More details [[https://www.atoptics.co.uk/rainbows/supers.htm][here]].

The picture below shows a faint secondary bow above the primary one,
and part of a supernumerary right below the primary violet shade.

These are very cool, but definitely not what I saw.

** Reflection rainbows
Reflection rainbows are formed by two separate bows: a primary one
caused by direct sunlight, and a *reflection* one above the primary,
caused by sunlight reflected on a water surface that must be behind
the observer, and calm enough for sunlight to reflect in a coherent
direction instead of scattering. The reflection bow is not concentric,
and appears above the primary one. More details [[https://www.atoptics.co.uk/rainbows/bowim6.htm][here]].

** Twinned rainbows
Twinned rainbows are very rare, and apparently not yet fully
understood. A possible explanation is that they're primary bows that
bifurcate in some sections due to the presence of larger droplets that
become non-spherical under the effect of air friction, and refract
light in a slightly different direction, so the rays that reach the
observer come from slightly above/below the primary bow. More details
[[https://www.atoptics.co.uk/rainbows/bowim28.htm][here]].

The picture below shows a twinned primary bow and secondary bow above
it (Source: [[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Alexander%E2%80%99s_band_will_1.jpg][Wikimedia Commons]])

* So, what did I see?
Given that the 2 bows in my picture were not concentric they could
only be a twinned primary bow, or a pair of primary and reflection
bows. I very much suspected it was the latter but I had no proof. A
sane person would have probably stopped there. I didn't.

My shamelessly biased starting assumption was: /If I can prove that a
reflection bow was very likely, then it probably was, given how rare
twinned bows seem to be, and how hard it would be to prove that it was
a twinned bow instead/.

So yeah, I essentially looked for my keys under the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streetlight_effect][streetlight]], not
where I had probably lost them. The good news is that using my
picture, some basic trigonometry and publically available maps and
astronomical data, I arrived at a pretty convincing answer: The top
bow in the picture matches a predicted *reflection bow* with
surprising accuracy (97%), so it most likely was. Below I'll detail
how I arrived at this conclusion.

I unitaterally decided had to answer these 2 questions:
1. /Is there a water surface where the Sun may have reflected?/
2. /Does the separation between primary and reflection bows in the
   picture match the expected value, given the Sun elevation at that
   time?/

The first one was relatively easy, I knew that the Firth of Forth was
somewhere behind the camera, but not exactly where, so I had to find
out. The second one was harder, because the bow separation changes
along the arcs. We'd ideally analyze the vertical separation at the
apex, but the bows were not complete, they faded out outside the
picture.

*** Sun, Camera and Water

I was lucky to find the [[https://www.suncalc.org/#/55.9316,-3.1718,11/2019.05.21/21:00/1/3][SunCalc]] site, and used it to generate a map of
the area that includes the Sun configuration relative to the camera
position at the time of observation (21/05/2019 21:00).

#+ATTR_HTML: :alt SunConfig :width 90%
[[../img/Rainbow/Rainbow-2019-05-22-SunConfig.png]]

This image answers question 1, and provides data that will help answer
question 2:
- The Sun direction matched the observed rainbow orientation, with an
  altitude of $2.7$ degrees above the horizon.
- There was a large water body that extends from
  $[10\text{km},16.5\text{km}]$ behind the camera, the Firth of Forth.

Assuming a perfect mirror water surface, we can infer that if the Sun
rays that caused the primary bow hit the raindrops with an angle of
${\color[RGB]{247,189,0} \alpha_p} = -2.7$ deg, then their specular
reflection on the water that caused the reflection bow hit the rain
droplets at an angle of ${\color[RGB]{0,126,225} \alpha_r} = +2.7$
deg.

*** Reconstructing the full bows from a partial picture

I needed the apex heights of the primary and reflection bows, but they
were incomplete, so I manually reconstructed the full bows from the
partial picture, by mirroring it horizontally, inverting the colors to
improve contrast, and matching a circle to each bow using
[[https://inkscape.org/][Inkscape]]. This is obviously an approximation, but the conclusion seems
to prove it was good enough, so hooray for scrappy Science.

#+ATTR_HTML: :alt Reconstructed bows :width 90%
[[../img/Rainbow/Rainbow-2019-05-22-RECONSTRUIT.png]]

From this picture I computed the heights in pixels:
${\color[RGB]{247,189,0} y_p} = 242$ px (primary) and
${\color[RGB]{0,126,225} y_r} = 284$ px (reflection). I did not count
the pixels one by one, I promise.

*** Identifying a reflection bow from known angles and heights

The diagram below shows primary bow data in orange and reflection bow
data in blue. Reflection triangle angles are $A=2.7$, $B=135.3$, $C=42$.

#+ATTR_HTML: :alt Angles :width 100%
[[../img/Rainbow/Rainbow_Angles.svg]]

The next diagram zooms on the observer-horizon-bow triangles on the
right of the observer (origin). View angles above the horizon are
${\color[RGB]{247,189,0} \theta_p} = 39.3$ and
${\color[RGB]{0,126,225} \theta_r} = 44.7$, computed from the known
light-eye droplet reflection angle $42$ and the Sun and reflection
elevations ${\color[RGB]{247,189,0} \alpha_p} = -2.7$ and
${\color[RGB]{0,126,225} \alpha_r} =2.7$.
#+ATTR_HTML: :alt Distance and Height :width 50%
[[../img/Rainbow/Rainbow_Angles_Zoomed.svg]]

Observer distances along the horizon (x-axis) to the primary and
reflection bows are unknown, but assumed to be equal
${\color[RGB]{247,189,0} x_p} = {\color[RGB]{0,126,225} x_r} = x$,
as they were most likely caused by the same curtain of raindrops.

Assuming bow apex heights in the picture are perpendicular to the
horizon (y-axis), we have 2 rectangle triangles
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \tan( {\color[RGB]{0,126,225} \theta_r} ) = {\color[RGB]{0,126,225} y_r} / x \\
  \tan( {\color[RGB]{247,189,0} \theta_p} ) = {\color[RGB]{247,189,0} y_p} / x
\end{eqnarray*}

we can get rid of the unknown $x$ easily by dividing the 2 equations

\[\frac{\tan( {\color[RGB]{0,126,225} \theta_r} )}{\tan( {\color[RGB]{247,189,0} \theta_p} )} =
\frac{ {\color[RGB]{0,126,225} y_r} }{ {\color[RGB]{247,189,0} y_p} }\]

and substituting known values on both sides we arrive at the approximate equality
\[1.209 \approx 1.173\]
with a relative error off $3\%$, or an accuracy of $97\%$, not too bad!

*** Are we done? I don't think so...

We have our answer, but it's slightly unsatisfying. In particular, we
used known angles, but we did not need to consider the distance to the
water at all... Maybe we can use it to validate or disprove the
conclusion?

One idea is to compute /how high is the rainbow?/ and verify the
answer is reasonable. Clouds at Edinburgh's latitude extend between
roughly 500m to 10km above the sea (details later). If we compute the
height and it's significantly outside that range we'd need to
reconsider.

*** <<QUESTION>> How +high+ *far* is the rainbow?

From the reconstructed picture we know the bow heights in /pixels/,
but not in /meters/. It turns out that with the data we have it's
easier to first compute the observer distance to the rainbow
${\color[RGB]{0,126,225} d_r}$ rather than its height
${\color[RGB]{0,126,225} y_r}$ over the horizon... This is worth
mentioning because, in general, the distance to a single primary bow
cannot be known: it could be anywhere along the viewing direction, and
we have no additional data required to triangulate its height (details
[[https://www.atoptics.co.uk/fz439.hth][here]]).

Fortunately, we know the distance range to the water reflection that
causes the reflection bow $c=[10,16.5]\text{km}$, so we can compute
its height ${\color[RGB]{0,126,225} y_r}$ as follows.

Using the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_sines][law of sines]]
\[
  \frac{a}{\sin(A)} = \frac{b}{\sin(B)} = \frac{c}{\sin(C)}
\]

we isolate ${\color[RGB]{0,126,225} d_r} = a$ and obtain a distance range
\[
{\color[RGB]{0,126,225} d_r} = c \frac{\sin(A)}{\sin(C)} =
[10,16.5] \times 0.0704 = [0.7,1.16] \text{km}
\]

and using ${\color[RGB]{0,126,225} d_r}$ and the view angle
${\color[RGB]{0,126,225} \theta_r}$ we obtain a height range

\[
{\color[RGB]{0,126,225} y_r}
= {\color[RGB]{0,126,225} d_r}\sin({\color[RGB]{0,126,225} \theta_r}) = [0.7,1.16] \times 0.703
= [0.492,0.816] \text{km}
\]

This range between roughly 500m to 800m is within the expected values
for low clouds, from 500m to 3km ([[https://www.weather.gov/key/low_clouds][details]]). The clouds in the picture
did look pretty low indeed, as usual in Edinburgh, so I'm finally
convinced: I saw a reflection rainbow, and my lost keys were under the
streetlight.

** Accounting for camera height over sea level                     :noexport:
Observer height above sea level was 70m ([[http://en-gb.topographic-map.com/][data]]) and can be considered
irrelevant, as it may only change the perceived height of the bows
over the horizon, but not their relative configuration.

According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon, horizon distance
is d = 3.57*sqrt(h) (d in km, h in meters), so at h=70m above the sea
level d = 30km, QUITE far away, so FoF sure falls inside it, and
actually, we should worry about horizon distance at rainbow height,
which may be quite far up (h=1000m approx in picture, if reflection at
farthest FoF border), so d = 113km, not far enough for the west coast
