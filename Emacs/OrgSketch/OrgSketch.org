#+STARTUP: indent
- Make a combo, open a drawing program, draw a doodle and save it in
  same dir /org-doodles and link it from the .org automatically
- Draw with finger on Dynamic
* Xournalapp https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp
- Very cool note taking and sketching app, and boots fast (appimage)
- Allows layers, moving stuff and text, best I've seen so far
- Touchscreen painting works but requires reassigning inputs in
  Edit/Preferences/Input (make Touchscreen device be considered as Mouse)
- Not sure if it can be called/integrated easily to export .png and
  quit from emacs itself
  - YES, xournalpp file.xopp -i file.png exports png
  - calling xournalpp file.xopp requires file.xopp to exist, so would
    need to be created first, and not sure it can be empty, so we
    probably need a template file to open/modify/save from
- Ex: [[file:tests/ContactVV.png]]
- Trim PNG whitespace with
  - convert input.png -trim output.png
  - must change background to Plain first, no notebook horizontal
    lines as default
- Scale/Rotate handles are too small for finger use, could rebuild
  from source and make them larger I guess
* org-krita https://github.com/lepisma/org-krita
- seems Wip, but is basically what I wanted
- plans to support other painting programs
- uses custom org-mode links (interesting, did that for p4/bugstar already)
- Could look at code and maybe adapt it
- Krita is quite heavyweight and seems pencil-oriented and complex,
  not sure how easy it is to move stuff around, etc...
- UI seems complex
* org-sketch file:org-sketch.el
** Basic (org-sketch-insert)
*** Idea
- org-sketch-insert (name)
- Open org-sketch-tool
  - Open with tool native empty template file name.ext
  - Ideally template.ext file is implicit, not required on disk (maybe
    can be created from elisp itself?)
- Blocks until tool is closed
  - WAIT on shell command... probably the default behaviour?
  - yes it is! ex: shell:gnome-paint blocks until closed
- When tool is closed
  - If file name.ext was saved, it calls tool again to export name.ext into name.png
    - Insert name.png as basic file link at point, unconditionally, with "name"
    - Maybe better prompt name before insertion, but default to
      ./org-sketckes/sketchNN.png if optional param was nil, so that
      we ALWAYS have a custom name for the sketch. and allow
      cancelling
  - If name.ext was not save (so remains empty), delete it
- The main objective is that with a SINGLE command we get the tool
  open and on save we have the sketch image inserted, 0 friction, no
  prompts to query name or any params
- default show inline images should work, nothing else required
- NO overlays, just simple image link
*** Tests

[[file:whatevs.png]]

*** DONE Using gnome-paing
*** DONE Using Xournal++
**** DONE Create .xopp template
**** DONE Convert .xopp to .png
*** DONE make "package"
- Do all standard stuff
  - (provide 'packaganame) seems to be enough
- Install in appropriate place
  - .emacs.d/lisp and add to load-path
- Require or load or whatever in init.el
  - Require on org hook
  - Set keybindings on org hook
** Advanced (org-sketch-mode?)
- minor mode, inspired in org-krita
- More features than standalone function
  - custom link type [sketch:name] that opens tool and allows
    creating/editing new/existing sketch on access, but also displays
    image as usual org-toggle-inline-images
  - customize empty template (org-sketch-tempalte-file)
  - custom sketch dir rel to .org file (ex ./sketches)
  - custom resolution (or select sizes: small, medium, large)
  - custom background colors/transparency
  - org exporting
  - overlays, toggle each indidivually, etc... display just added by
    default (customizable)
  - Delete sketch: when link is deleted, image file is deleted too
  - Sketch database or directory, etc...
*** TODO Add GIMP TOOL
*** TODO Add Inkscape TOOL
*** TODO Add Windows support
**** TODO Add Paint TOOL
**** TODO Modify paths and /dev/null for Windows
*** TODO Detect available TOOLs and choose "best"
- Best is the fastest to load, I guess, but allow custom ordering
