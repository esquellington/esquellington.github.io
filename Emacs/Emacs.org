Emacs hacking and tests

* org-mode stuff: file:advanced_org_features.org
* Literary programming exercise: file:test-avx.org
* Preview LaTeX formulas code comments
** DONE Requirements for EASY LaTeX math preview in C/C++ comments
*** Should work like texfrag-region/document, but for whole comments/functions/files
- See texfrag code, looks complex and uses auctex, which DOES NOT WORK
  IN WINDOWS
- It also uses preview for intermediate steps, which seems to be a
  generic way to do this in emacs
*** 0-config, work by default
**** Avoid dependencies, try to invoke latex/dvips directly and display overlay
**** NO need to flag latex blocks, just look for $, $$, \[ and \begin{} pairs like texfrag does
**** Automatic scaling of formulas to font size (should be readable by default)
*** 0-interference
**** KEEP plain text edit of comments working at ALL TIMES
**** if cursor is in a formula, disable the preview while there

** TODO laic (latex-in-comments)
- file:LaTeX/laic.el
*** References
- texfrag-moode
  - Enable C-c C-p C-p for preview-at-point or preview-region
  - Remove with preview-clearout-buffer
  - See file:latex.cpp for inline math in comments
  - DOES NOT WORK
    - Same issue as here https://latex.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=27378
- See [[https://github.com/mneri/pnglatex][pnglatex]], works very well
  - Could do the same ops from elisp
  - Support math-environment as part of formula text, no point in
    having to specify it explicitly
- See http://mazack.org/unix/tex2png.php, also useful
- This explains how to create overlays and image tooltips
  http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/blog/2016/03/21/Displaying-image-overlays-on-image-filenames-in-Emacs/
*** DONE Call latex*dvipng to get formula image .png
- Autogen temp .tex with proper document class and includes
- Generate proper size image
- latex/dvipng/convert -trim also works for any latex "page"
- .tex must have simple structure
- .tex should have \pagestyle{empty} to avoid page number at bottom
  from stopping convert -trim
*** DONE Insert .png image in Emacs buffer
- As overlay??
- Toggle between text/formula
*** DONE Name it --> laic
- laic = latex-in-comments
- love = latex-overlay
- loverlay
- overlaytex
- clover = comments latex overlay
- glasstex? put them on and see formulas?
- greekvision? geek/greek vision
*** DONE Set proper colors
- Set fore/background color to proper values from Emacs theme at 1st
  latex block delimiter
*** DONE Extend to all formulas in a region or buffer
- Use regexp to match all delimiter pairs, and gather points begin,end
- Gen overlay image for each match
- match only in comments, not everywhere?
  - texfrag has texfrag-comments-only
*** DONE Optionally run in comments only
*** TODO Find text in formula delimiters around point
**** DONE \[ \]
**** TODO Other delimiters
- \begin/end equation,eqnarray,align, and non-numbered versions,
  useful but require non-trivial matching of text inside {}
- $ and $$ will be tricky because they're symmetric begin/end
- texfrag probably does this, check code
  - texfrag-next-frag-function
- Regexp to match region?
  - SO it seems regex CANNOT match balanced structs, so \[a\] \[b\]
    are matched as a SINGLE string, instead of 2 groups
  - Thus, we should only match the beginnings \[ and FROM THERE,
    match the first \]
- Probably the best commands would be
  - "convert closest not yet converted"
    - So, search back and if there's a BEGIN closer than an END, then
      search forward for an END
  - "toggle closest"
  - prioritize begin/end region containing cursor, otherwise go forward?
*** TODO Package as a minor mode with keybindings
- keybindings
  - See/toggle closest to point
  - See all
  - Clear all
*** TODO Consider ov package for overlay niceties
*** TODO Consider tooltip instead of overlay
- Less intrusive
- Optional?
*** TODO Syntax-highlight latex blocks in comments
- Highlight subtly even when no overlay has been created, ideally
  subtly different shade of comment color, I think Org does something similar
*** TODO BUGS
**** TODO Foreground color is sometimes wrong
- Background is always correct though
- Could it happen on stuff not in screen only? not sure how to repro it
- If we stick to "in-comments" version, then we could just get the
  color from comment font lock properties
* Magit mode HowTo
- C-x g runs magit-status
- On status buffer
  - tab toggles per-file diff
  - 's' on "unstaged" changes toggles them to "staged"
  - 'c' and then 'c' opens commit buffer for "staged" changes, input commit
    description and then press C-c to perform commit. Files become
    "unmerged"
  - 'P' and then 'p' pushes commits to "master" (remote) branch after
    asking for username/password.
* Pico8-mode
- Consider custom mode for easy code section narrowing of .p8 files,
  syntax highlight, re-launching game, etc...
