* Player
** DONE Animation as seq of frames
** DONE Combined {idle,jump} x shoot
** DONE Jump over a wall we're next to
   - As in GnG, jump is not controllable, but if you jump right while
     next to a right wall, you jump past it
   - basically, the horizontal jump speed needs to reset every frame,
     and cancelled only when there's a collision
** TODO Hit/Death
** TODO Contextual actions (on_ground, on_wall, on_cliff, etc...)
* Collision detection
** DONE BP using map tiles as grid
** DONE CCD with sequential treatment

** DONE room change
** TODO Scroll

  - Death/Evaporate
    - Gen flashing white pixels that fade up/directionally to impact)
  - Dark areas using flickering/dither
* BUGS
** TODO Shoot repetition if direction pressed
** TODO Stop idle/run movement while falling
* FW
** TODO RLE anims
   - list of key + repetitions
** TODO Generic animation system
    - Allow 1 cycle + 1 optional action
    - Rename Action to Cycle
    - Actions end automatically
    - Cycles repeat automatically
    - Action/Cycle are Animations and have explicit list of frames {1,2,...}
    - Transition table/FSA
      - States x {Inputs + Events}
      - States: Idle,Run,Jump...
        - OnEntwr/OnExit
      - Inputs: LRUDZX
      - Events: EndAnim,Hit...
