* DONE Player
** DONE Animation as seq of frames
** DONE Combined {idle,jump} x shoot
** DONE Jump over a wall we're next to
   - As in GnG, jump is not controllable, but if you jump right while
     next to a right wall, you jump past it
   - basically, the horizontal jump speed needs to reset every frame,
     and cancelled only when there's a collision
** DONE Hit/Death
** DONE (WON'T DO) Contextual actions (on_ground, on_wall, on_cliff, etc...)
* DONE Collision detection

** TODO Hit SFX
* DONE Enemies
** Simple plans
   - Periodic: linear vel, stay, go back (ex: saws)
     - no CD except for player/bullets
   - Patrol: Forward until collision, then turn (ex: worm)
     - do not fall off cliffs, do not even go to the border
   - Charge: Wait until player visible/close, then walk towards it
   - Fly: Wait until player visible/close, then fly straight and disappear
   - Fall: fall down on player when below
   - Fly and Seek: Go towards player, no map collisions
** DONE Worm
   - Patrol
** DONE Angry worm
   - Patrol faster
** DONE Mouse
   - Patrol
** DONE Grunt
   - Charge
   - Fixed timeout between attacks can be any time, no need to be
     exact idle duration
   - Hit ground shoots wave projectile both ways
** DONE Cthulhu
*** DONE Patrol
*** DONE Shoot periodically if player at same level
** DONE Spit projectile
   - It's a projectile implemented as an enemy
   - Should hit walls
** DONE Bird
   - Fly directly when inside inner radius, stop when outside radius
     and retarget
** DONE Arachno
   - Patrol
   - Jump on player at fixed angle
     - 45 deg trivial solution
   - Low grav to reduce jump speed
** DONE Teeth
   - Patrol fast
   - Indestructible
** DONE Saw
   - place properly acc to range
   - hitbox less unforgiving
   - inverse version
** DONE Stalactite
*** TODO fall when player DIRECTLY below
*** TODO remove from map permanently
     - FLAG enemies as "persistent" and if true, remember map cell
       they were created from and overwrite it with contents from cell
       above
     - could be a difficulty option, undead mode would regen
       everything, including bosses
** DONE Boss: Skull Executioner
   - Jump on player spot
     - Player must move fast when SE is in the air
   - Open mouth and shoot skulls Straight/Sinusoid
     - Player must be at reasonable distance and jump over or duck
       below skulls
     - NO double-jump available
** DONE Skull projectile
** DONE Boss: Flame Executioner
   - Charge
     - Player must double-jump over it
   - Throw parabolic flames that stick to the ground for a while
     - Player must avoid projectiles and ground and wall flames
** DONE Flame projectile
   - Stick to solid tiles
   - Burn for a while and disappear (timeout)
** DONE Angry skeleton
   - On first pass, do nothing
   - On second pass, spawn ghosts that fly slowly to player
** DONE Boss: Final Boss
*** DONE Intro
    - Play organ for N secs, then fly to mid screen
*** DONE Phase 1:
   - Hover mid-scrren, inaccessible, and shoot N straight shots
     directed to player
*** TODO Phase 2:
   - Hitting organ gens note/sfx that stuns boss
   - 2 correct notes will bring him down so that he can be attacked
   - When recovering, he Shoot radial bullets massively and returns to
     safe spot
*** TODO Phase 3:
   - Move faster, more difficult to stun
   - Slam ground periodically creating shockwaves (the ones originally for the
     Grunt) player Must jump over
** TODO Boss: Caterpillar nest
   - Normal caterpillars dig into room from ground, walls, ceiling,
     convert to angry and attack.
** TODO Boss: Spider room
   - Spiders patrol on walls and jump on player randomly
   - Extend jump_on_ground to accept work with different heights
** TODO Boss: Rocks falling
   - Rocks fall from ceiling and stack up
   - Some can be destroyed
   - Like puzzle platformer

    - Move camera with noise
** DONE (WON'T DO) Dark areas using flickering/dither
* TODO Balance
** DONE Boss energy HUD
** DONE Broom makes everything too easy, but FINB and FLAB need it
** DONE FlameBoss is too hard, actually impossible due to ramming if the player does not have the broom
** TODO Balance flying skulls
   - if player has broom, they're very easy and should instead move to
     player constantly, otherwise, they should move in straight lines.
* TODO Polish
** TODO Use free sprites to add detail/variety
** DONE Auto transition from intro/ending to game/menu
** DONE (WON'T DO) Golden key could lead to secret room behind bishop door, procedurally generated, to include all enemies in different "stands" like a gallery
* DONE BUGS
** DONE bosses remain dead after continue, so if final boss is dead the game cannot be replayed without resetting the cartridge
** DONE Collision bugs:
   - A solution would be to do pos correction for blocks overlapped at
     t=0, this would stop the problem from accumulating
   - The direction should mindepth, ignoring previous position
   - works for y when broom, not robust otherwise, but good enough,
     DONE :-P
*** TODO sometimes char passes through blocks
*** TODO collision bugs when hit or on broomstick
*** TODO miissing or late wall/ceiling collision when changing rooms
    - make room change more robust by placing char strictly at the
      border regardless of speed
** DONE AABB sizes are a bit wrong when inverted (seem to drift left)
   - bah who cares...
* TODO Write

    - Allow 1 cycle + 1 optional action
    - Rename Action to Cycle
    - Actions end automatically
    - Cycles repeat automatically
    - Action/Cycle are Animations and have explicit list of frames {1,2,...}
    - Transition table/FSA
