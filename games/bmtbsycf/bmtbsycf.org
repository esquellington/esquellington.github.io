   - After fixing aabb_apply_sign to avoid changing aabb when turning,
     it became apparent that the max side (right/bottom) of the aabbs
     collide incorrectly by 1 pixel.
   - This problem is probably in aabb collision routines using min/max
     differently.
   - IMPORTANT: The MIN pixel is included, but the MAX pixel is NOT,
     as min/max are length coordinates, NOT pixel coordinates. It an
     also be seen as a closedd/open interval [min,max) in pixels.
   - AABB debug drawing already takes this into account to draw the
     outline so that the outer side represents exactly the expected
     solid boundary.
